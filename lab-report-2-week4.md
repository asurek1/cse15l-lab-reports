# Lab Report 2 - Week 4

## Lab 3 Bug Changes

In Lab 3, we were given a java file named MarkdownParse.java. The code within the file worked for a few test cases, but with certain test cases, there will be an error. Our lab group fixed the code, so there will no longer be any errors when running these test cases. Below are examples of three bugs in the code that we fixed.
